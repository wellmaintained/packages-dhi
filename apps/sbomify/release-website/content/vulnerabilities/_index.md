All container images are scanned with [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)
against the latest vulnerability database. Scans run weekly (Monday 06:00 UTC)
and on every pre-release build. Known false positives are suppressed via
per-image [VEX](https://openvex.dev) statements.

## Methodology

1. SBOMs are extracted from OCI attestations attached to each container image
2. Grype scans each SBOM against the latest vulnerability database
3. Known false positives are suppressed via per-image VEX statements — the
   VEX status column shows the triage decision and justification
4. Remaining findings are triaged per the remediation SLA

**Stock DHI images** receive VEX documents from Docker Hardened Images (OpenVEX
JSON, signed, broad coverage). **Custom images** use hand-written OpenVEX YAML
maintained alongside the DHI YAML definitions.
